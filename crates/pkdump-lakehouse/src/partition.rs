//! Which raw runs a date's derive reads, and when it refuses to run at all.
//!
//! The derive is scheduled separately from the landing, deliberately: a
//! derive can then run against yesterday's raw on a night the fetch failed.
//! The trap on the other side of that feature is the one this module exists
//! to close —
//!
//! > yesterday's raw silently deriving today's `shared` and looking current.
//!
//! So there is no "newest available" anywhere in here. The job is told a date
//! and builds *that* date or stops. What this module decides is the narrower
//! question of which of a date's runs to read, and what makes a date
//! underivable:
//!
//! - **a required dataset that landed nothing** — the date was never fetched,
//!   or was fetched by something that is not a refresh. Refuse.
//! - **a required dataset with no complete run** — parts exist, but nothing in
//!   the landing zone can say whether they add up to a day (the writer never
//!   learns how many parts it was owed). A smaller catalog reads as *cards
//!   that do not exist*, so refuse rather than build one.
//! - **runs that disagree about the clock** — see [`clock_of`].
//!
//! Two datasets are optional, and both for the same reason: an ordinary
//! refresh does not necessarily fetch them. `pokemontcgio/cards` is fetched
//! only for sets the catalog does not already have, so a night with no new
//! set lands none; `pokemon-tcg-data/bulk` is `pkdump setup`'s bulk corpus and
//! a refresh never fetches it at all. Absent, they contribute no URLs and any
//! request for one becomes a replay miss — which is loud (see
//! [`crate::replay`]) rather than silent.
