//! Shared scaffolding for this crate's unit tests. Compiled out of any real
//! build.
//!
//! The master key's location is an environment variable, so every test that
//! needs a key mutates process-wide state and they cannot be allowed to
//! overlap — the same guard `pkdump-keys` and `pkdump-ship` carry, for the
//! same reason.
//!
//! Nothing here is anybody's data. The "holdings" are the string `not real
//! holdings` and the printing ids are invented; the tenant zone is the
//! SUBJECT of this design, so its fixtures are treated as if they were real.
