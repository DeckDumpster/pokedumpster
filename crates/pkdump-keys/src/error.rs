//! What can go wrong, kept **distinguishable on purpose**.
//!
//! This module is the load-bearing half of `pd-ulds`. Crypto-shredding has a
//! property that is a feature and a hazard at the same time:
//!
//! > **A lost key is indistinguishable from a deleted tenant.**
//!
//! Cryptographically that is the whole point — ciphertext nobody holds a key
//! for is ciphertext nobody can read, and *why* nobody holds the key does not
//! change the maths. Operationally it is a trap, because the two causes call
//! for opposite responses:
//!
//! * *the key was destroyed on purpose* — the system is working; the account
//!   is gone and must stay gone.
//! * *the key cannot be found* — the system is broken; restore it from the
//!   backup, and page somebody until that happens.
//!
//! Collapse those into one error and the failure is silent in both
//! directions. A backup failure starts reading as a legitimate deletion (data
//! loss wearing compliance as a costume), or a deletion gets implemented as
//! "we lost the backup", which revokes nothing the moment the backup turns up.
//!
//! So they are separate variants, and [`KeyError::is_deliberate_revocation`]
//! is the ONLY sanctioned way to ask "was this on purpose". It answers `true`
//! for exactly one variant. A caller — item 8's deletion path above all —
//! that wants to report "this tenant is gone" has to go through it, and
//! cannot get a `true` out of a missing file, an unreadable registry or an
//! I/O error no matter how it phrases the question.
