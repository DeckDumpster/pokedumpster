//! What can go wrong, kept apart from what a tenant's own state can say.
//!
//! The distinction that matters here is the one [`pkdump_keys::KeyError`]
//! draws and this crate must not blur: a tenant that cannot be shipped
//! because its key was **destroyed on purpose** is the system working, and a
//! tenant that cannot be shipped because something is **broken** is not.
//! [`crate::run`] turns the first into a skip nobody is paged for and the
//! second into one somebody is, so the two never arrive as one error string.
