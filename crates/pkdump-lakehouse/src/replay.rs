//! Answering an upstream request out of `raw/`.
//!
//! A raw partition is a **URL → bytes** map and always was: the manifest
//! records the URL of every part beside its key and digest, precisely so the
//! landing zone can be read back without a parser. So replay is a lookup, not
//! a reimplementation — [`RawReplay`] resolves the URL a client was about to
//! request and hands back the body that URL returned when it was landed. The
//! derivation above it does not know, and must not know, which happened:
//! comparing two runs of one derivation is what makes "row-identical" a claim
//! about *provenance*. Comparing two implementations would only ever be a
//! claim about the second one.
//!
//! ## A miss is fatal
//!
//! A URL the partition has no record of means **raw coverage has regressed** —
//! the derivation grew an input the landing zone does not capture, or an
//! upstream's origin moved. That is a refusal, full stop.
//!
//! A URL the partition has a *failure* record for is a different fact and gets
//! a different sentence (pd-llbq). Nothing regressed there: that request was
//! made, it exhausted its retries, and the landing zone wrote down what it
//! answered. There is nothing to replay because there was nothing to land, and
//! the derivation fails at exactly the request the fetch failed at — which is
//! what makes a partial night replay to the catalog the online refresh built
//! rather than to a different one. Which of the two it is decides whether the
//! job exits 1 or 2, so telling an operator "re-land the date" for a night
//! upstream was down would be advice that cannot work.
//!
//! Item 2 of the epic shipped with a temporary fallback for that case: reach
//! the live upstream, say so loudly, and let the run finish. It was there to
//! keep the offline derive usable while row-identity was still unproven, and
//! item 4 deleted it once pd-vves proved it against the real bucket. What is
//! left is the behaviour `--no-upstream-fallback` used to select, now the only
//! behaviour there is — and it is structural rather than a policy this module
//! chooses: [`ReplaySource::missing`] returns the error itself, so a replaying
//! wire has no path to the network for this module to decline to take.
//!
//! The reason it could not stay is that a fallback makes the landing zone
//! decorative. A derive that reaches upstream produces a correct catalog with a
//! LINEAGE that is not reproducible — every gate passes, every row looks right,
//! and we would find out on the day an upstream is down, which is the day the
//! lake was bought for. Loudness was a mitigation for that, not a fix: it
//! depends on somebody reading the log.
//!
//! The one phase that still fetches on the offline path is set-symbol
//! normalisation, and it does not come through here at all —
//! `symbols::normalize_all_symbols` has no [`Wire`](pkdump_ingest::landing::Wire)
//! in its signature and builds its own client, because images are deliberately
//! outside `raw/`. See `pkdump-derive`'s crate docs, and
//! `row_identical.rs::a_cold_derive_fetches_set_symbols_live_and_is_not_refused_for_it`
//! for the gate that holds that apart from this rule.
