-- Registry database schema — the logical→physical map (pd-fci1).
--
-- One row per user: the handle the outside world names them by, and the
-- opaque database id that names their file on disk. Two separate facts,
-- joined by this table rather than by string equality.
--
-- Its own file at the data root: NOT a table in shared.sqlite (which every
-- tenant connection ATTACHes readable, so a roster there would be visible to
-- every tenant), and NOT under tenants/ (which would break "every *.sqlite
-- under tenants/ is a tenant", the statement the Litestream glob rests on).
--
-- Re-applied idempotently on every open, like the other two schemas.
--
-- Three rules live HERE rather than in the accessor, because the data model
-- for the application belongs in the schema:
--
--   1. `database_id` is the PRIMARY KEY. It is the stable identity; a handle
--      is a mutable label on it. That is this epic's whole thesis, and the
--      table says so rather than a comment in Rust.
--   2. The handle format is a CHECK, so every write is held to it no matter
--      which code path inserts — accessor, migration, or an operator with
--      sqlite3 open on the file.
--   3. Handle reuse is a PARTIAL UNIQUE INDEX. A handle is unique among
--      ACTIVE users only, so `detach` is an ordinary state change and the
--      retired row keeps the person's real handle.

    -- The same charset crate::paths::validate_tenant_name admits, spelled as

    -- share an implementation — one is a Rust function, the other is checked

    -- crate::paths::HANDLE_CASES is run through the validator by
    -- paths::tests::tenant_names_are_validated and through this CHECK by

    -- and one of those two fails. It matters because the validator is also

-- ── KEY CUSTODY (pd-ulds) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Per-tenant encryption keys for the tenant zone are DERIVED, never stored:
-- HKDF(master key, database_id). So there is no key column here and never will
-- be — the only thing worth recording is whether this database's key may still
-- be derived at all. See crates/pkdump-keys.
--
-- Three properties of this table are decisions, not implementation:
--
--   1. NO FOREIGN KEY to user(database_id). A tombstone must OUTLIVE the row
--      it names. `pkdump tenant purge` deletes the user row; if that cascaded
--      to the tombstone, deletion would silently un-revoke the key it just
--      destroyed and the account would become readable again the moment the
--      partition was restored from anywhere. The tombstone is the durable
--      half of the deletion, so it deliberately does not depend on the
--      ephemeral half.
--   2. ABSENCE IS NOT PERMISSION. Derivation requires an explicit `active`
--      row; a database_id with no row here is refused (KeyError::NotRegistered)
--      rather than derived for. A registry restored empty is missing its
--      tombstones as well as its users, and the fail-closed direction is the
--      one where that is loud.
--   3. A TOMBSTONE IS TERMINAL. There is no path back to 'active' — not in
--      the accessor, and the CHECK below means an operator with sqlite3 open
--      on the file cannot half-do it either (clearing the state without
--      clearing tombstoned_at, or the reverse, fails the row constraint).
--      Revocation that can be undone by accident is not revocation.
--
-- What this table is NOT is the master key's business. The master key is a
-- file; this is a database. Backing the key up never touches a row here, and
-- tombstoning a tenant never touches that file — see crates/pkdump-keys, where
-- the two paths are kept apart on purpose.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tenant_key (
    -- The database whose key state this is. Opaque ULID, exactly as
    -- user.database_id — but joined by value, never by constraint (1, above).
    database_id   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,

-- ── IDENTITY BINDINGS (db-dbb9) ───────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- One row per (verified identity, tenant) binding. A person proves who they
-- are by presenting a Cloudflare Access JWT; this table maps the email in
-- that JWT to the tenant they own.
--
-- Four design decisions, stated here rather than in the accessor alone:
--
--   1. BOUND TO database_id, NOT handle. A handle is a mutable label;
--      database_id is the stable identity. An identity bound to a handle
--      would follow a rename onto whoever takes that handle next.
--   2. KEYED ON email, sub STORED ALONGSIDE. The Access policy is written
--      in terms of email addresses; keying on email means the two systems
--      agree by construction. sub is kept for audit and for detecting a
--      provider change (same address, different sub), which should be
--      surfaced, not silently accepted or refused.
--   3. EMAIL NORMALISATION IS A CHECK. The stored value must already be
--      lowercase — `email = lower(email)` is enforced here, not by the
--      accessor alone. The accessor normalises before inserting; this check
--      holds every writer to it. Both are tested against EMAIL_CASES in
--      crate::registry so they cannot drift.
--   4. ONE EMAIL PER ACTIVE TENANT. Several identities per tenant (a person
--      with two addresses) is allowed; one identity mapping to several ACTIVE
--      tenants is refused — ambiguous at resolution time. The uniqueness index
--      is partial on user_state = 'active' so a detached tenant's email is
--      freed for re-onboarding. user_state mirrors user.state via the trigger
--      below.
--
-- Deletion obligation: when a tenant is deleted, their identity rows must
-- be removed too — they are personal data. pkdump-erase handles the offline
-- half; registry::delete handles the online half. Neither may skip this.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_identity (
    -- Stable; unchanged by renames.

    -- provider migration.
    --
    -- The CHECK verifies that what is stored is already normalised — it does
    -- not normalise. The Rust normalise_email() lowercases before inserting;
    -- this check holds every writer to the same thing. Two implementations
    -- of "normalised" that cannot share code share EMAIL_CASES instead —
    -- the same pattern as HANDLE_CASES for handles.

    PRIMARY KEY (database_id, email)
);

-- One email maps to at most ONE ACTIVE tenant.
--
-- Several identities per tenant is allowed (a person with two addresses).
-- One identity mapping to several ACTIVE tenants is refused — ambiguous at
-- resolution time, and that ambiguity must not be writable rather than
-- handled in code.
--
-- Partial on user_state = 'active' so that a detached user's email is freed
-- for re-onboarding: detach is an ordinary state change, not a deletion.
