//! One part, as Parquet.
//!
//! The tenant zone is plain partitioned Parquet (`pd-uz8q`) — plain because
//! Iceberg records absolute paths and would make a later bucket split a
//! metadata rewrite, partitioned because a deletion has to be a prefix drop.
//! This module is the only place a batch of outbox rows becomes those bytes.
//!
//! ## The schema is the outbox's, not the collection's
//!
//! ```text
//! message holdings_event {
//!   required int64  seq;
//!   required binary occurred_at (UTF8);
//!   required binary source_table (UTF8);
//!   required binary op (UTF8);
//!   required int64  row_id;
//!   required binary payload (UTF8);   // the whole row, as the trigger wrote it
//!   required binary source (UTF8);    // trigger | backfill | redrive
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! It is [`pkdump_db::outbox::Event`]'s seven fields, all of them, because it
//! IS that struct (pd-mixm) — so a column added to `ownership_outbox` fails
//! this module to compile rather than quietly stopping at the bucket.
//!
//! ## Carrying `source` is not branching on it
//!
//! Rule 2 of the outbox's design forbids a *consumer* that treats a
//! backfilled event differently from a triggered one — the moment it does,
//! backfill stops being the same path. It does not forbid recording which it
//! was, and dropping the column would cost two things: an operator asking
//! "did last night's redrive actually reach the zone" would have nothing in
//! the zone to answer with, and `decode` could not rebuild an [`Event`] at
//! all, so a reader could not hand a part to [`pkdump_db::outbox::project`]
//! — the one implementation of the resolution rule — without inventing the
//! field. This crate reads it nowhere.
//!
//! `payload` stays the JSON object the trigger built rather than being
//! flattened into typed columns, and that is a decision. The outbox's payload
//! is already pinned to `collection`'s columns by a test that compares the two
//! (`pd-5m54`), so flattening here would add a *third* place the collection's
//! shape is written down — one that no test could hold to the other two
//! without reimplementing the comparison. Passing the object through means a
//! column added to `collection` reaches the zone the night it lands, with no
//! shipper change and nothing to forget. A reader that wants a column asks
//! for it with `json_extract`, which is what DuckDB is for.
//!
//! `database_id` is deliberately **not** a column: the partition carries it,
//! and [`crate::cipher`] binds each object to its own key, so a second copy
//! inside the file could only ever disagree with those.
//!
//! ## `row_id` alone identifies nothing — the key is (`source_table`, `row_id`)
//!
//! `row_id` is unique only WITHIN a source table (pd-4gop). `collection` and
//! `sealed_collection` number their rows independently, so the first single
//! and the first sealed lot are BOTH `row_id = 1` — which is the ordinary
//! shape of a collection, not a corner case. A reader that grouped this
//! dataset by `row_id` would silently merge two unrelated streams of events
//! into one projection and produce a number that looks entirely plausible.
//!
//! So `source_table` is carried in every part, beside `row_id`, and it is
//! there for that reason rather than for provenance. **The shipper itself
//! keys nothing on either**: its only key is `seq`, which is unique across the
//! whole outbox. The pair is here for whatever reads these parts.
//!
//! (`payload` also carries the row's own `id`, but only the pair says which
//! table that id is in — so it is no substitute either.)
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! `created_by` is pinned rather than left to the writer, so two builds of
//! this crate produce identical footers. Byte-identity is a property *within*
//! a build of the `parquet` crate: an upgrade that changes its encoding would
//! make a re-ship of an already-shipped part write different bytes to the same
//! key. That is still the same rows at the same address — idempotent in the
//! sense the design asks for — but it is why the gate that compares bytes runs
//! against one build rather than across two.
