/**
 * The UI primitives — PokeDumpster's visual vocabulary.
 *
 * Routes import from here and stop making their own decisions about surfaces,
 * fills, rules and spacing:
 *
 *     import { Panel, Button, Field } from '$lib/components/ui';
 *
 * Every one of them is styled entirely from SEMANTIC tokens
 * (`--color-*`, `--space-*`, `--text-*`, `--radius-*`, `--shadow-*`). None
 * reaches into the `--pd-*` reference layer, and none contains a colour
 * literal — `frontend/tests/primitives/` fails per primitive if that stops
 * being true.
 *
 * A route that needs a variant this file doesn't have should ADD the variant
 * here rather than restyle a primitive at the call site: the moment two
 * routes patch the same primitive differently, the system is back to taste.
