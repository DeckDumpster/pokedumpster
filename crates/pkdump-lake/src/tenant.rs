//! The **tenant zone** — where holdings and valuations live offline.
//!
//! A different object from the catalog zone that happens to share a bucket
//! with it. `raw/` and `lake/` are cross-tenant, shared, indefinitely
//! retained and read with broad credentials; `tenant/` is always
//! tenant-keyed, retained 90 days, and read with credentials that reach
//! nothing else. The standing rule — *tenant data never enters the lake* —
//! is about the CATALOG, and it is restated here rather than broken: the
//! tenant zone is governed separately, which is the whole reason it is a
//! separate zone at all.
//!
//! ```text
//! tenant/database_id=<id>/dataset=<holdings|valuations>/as_of=YYYY-MM-DD/part-NNNN.parquet
//! ```
//!
//! Four things about that line are decisions, not implementation:
//!
//! - **`database_id` is the FIRST partition.** Deleting a tenant has to be a
//!   prefix drop, and putting the id above `dataset=` makes ONE prefix cover
//!   that tenant's holdings *and* their valuations. Derived artifacts
//!   inherit the deletion obligation, so they must not need a second sweep
//!   to find. [`tenant_prefix`] is that prefix, and it is the unit item 8
//!   drops.
//! - **Plain partitioned Parquet, not Iceberg.** Iceberg records absolute
//!   paths in its metadata, so moving this zone to its own bucket later
//!   would mean rewriting manifests; plain files keep that a location
//!   change. It also gives up snapshots and time travel deliberately —
//!   holdings want CURRENT STATE per tenant, deletable, not history.
//! - **Hive-style `key=value` components**, matching [`crate::keys`], so a
//!   reader (DuckDB, pyarrow) recovers the partition values from the path
//!   without a side table.
//! - **`as_of=` is a date, and retention is measured on OBJECT AGE.** See
//!   [`RETENTION_DAYS`]: an object written today is gone in 90 days whatever
//!   its `as_of` says, so a tenant whose state is still current has to be
//!   re-materialised inside that window or they age out of the zone. That is
//!   a constraint on the shipper, stated here because this module is what
//!   makes it true.
//!
//! ## What this module is not
//!
//! It is not a writer. Nothing in this crate puts an object under `tenant/`
//! — the shipper is its own item, and until it exists the zone is meant to
//! be empty. What lives here is where the bytes will go and who is allowed
//! to reach them; the policy documents that *enforce* the second half are in
//! `deploy/policies/tenant-zone/`, and `tests/lake/tenant_zone.sh` is what
//! proves they are not merely decorative.
