//! Where landed objects go, and where a rebuild reads them back from.
//!
//! Two traits with two implementations each: [`S3Store`], which is the real
//! one, and [`DirStore`], a directory on disk that exists so the landing
//! zone's behaviour can be asserted hermetically — the key layout, the
//! manifest and the never-overwrite property are all properties of the
//! *keys*, and proving them against a bucket would make the gate need
//! credentials and a network.
//!
//! The traits are separate on purpose. [`ObjectStore`] is what a *landing*
//! run holds, and it is still write-only: a run knows its own key space and
//! must not be able to look at anybody else's. [`ObjectSource`] is what the
//! offline derive holds, and it is read-only for the mirror-image reason —
//! `raw/` is immutable, and a job that could PUT into it could rewrite the
//! evidence it exists to preserve. Nothing implements both halves *as one
//! handle*; the two are constructed from the same config by different
//! entry points ([`crate::open`] and [`crate::open_reader`]).
//!
//! [`ObjectPurge`] is the third, and it is narrower than either: enumerate a
//! prefix, and remove one key. It exists for exactly one caller — the tenant
//! zone's deletion sweep (`pd-qbrf`) — and it deliberately has no `get` and
//! no `put`, because a job whose business is *removing* a tenant's holdings
//! has none reading them and none adding to them. It is handed out only by
//! [`crate::open_tenant_zone_purge`], never by [`crate::open`].
