//! **The partition drop.** One tenant's prefix, emptied.
//!
//! ```text
//! tenant/database_id=<id>/          <- the whole of what a Sweep may touch
//!     dataset=holdings/as_of=…/part-seq-…
//!     dataset=valuations/as_of=…/part-…
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why this is a prefix and not a query
//!
//! `database_id` is the FIRST partition component of the tenant zone
//! (`pkdump_lake::tenant`), above `dataset=`, and that ordering was chosen for
//! this module: one prefix covers a tenant's holdings *and* their valuations,
//! so derived artifacts inherit the deletion obligation without a second sweep
//! having to go and find them. It is also why the zone is plain Parquet rather
//! than Iceberg — dropping a prefix is a delete per object, where an Iceberg
//! row delete is a file rewrite.
//!
//! ## The confinement
//!
//! A [`Sweep`] is constructed for one `database_id` and computes its own
//! prefix from it. Every key it is about to delete is checked against that
//! prefix first, and a key outside it is [`EraseError::OutsideThePrefix`] —
//! fatal, not skipped. The keys come from listing that same prefix, so under
//! normal operation the check can never fire; it is there because the cost of
//! being wrong is another tenant's data, and because a listing is an answer
//! from a remote service rather than a fact.
//!
//! ## What a second run does
//!
//! Finishes. Deletion is re-run after a crash and after a partial failure,
//! `delete` on an absent key is not an error at either store, and a prefix
//! holding nothing lists empty — so [`Sweep::drop_partition`] on an
//! already-dropped tenant reports zero objects and succeeds. That is the
//! property that lets the tombstone go first: an interrupted deletion leaves a
//! tenant nothing can derive a key for, and the sweep can be finished at
//! leisure.
