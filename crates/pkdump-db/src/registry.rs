//! The user registry — the table that joins a *handle* to a *database*.
//!
//! Before this, a tenant's name was three things at once: the value in an
//! unauthenticated header, the filename on disk, and the S3 replica prefix.
//! One string doing all three is what made `pd-pm7b` possible — delete
//! `alice`, recreate `alice`, and the new database lands under the old
//! one's replica stream for the rest of the retention window.
//!
//! Here they are two facts joined by a row:
//!
//! * `handle` — what a request names, what a person types. Renameable.
//! * `database_id` — an opaque ULID, the stem of `tenants/<id>.sqlite`.
//!   Assigned here, never chosen by a caller, never derived from the handle.
//!
//! Recreating a released handle therefore *cannot* inherit the old
//! database or its replica: it gets a fresh ULID, so it is a different file
//! under a different prefix. Not fixed — unreachable.
//!
//! ULID because it is filename-safe and creation-ordered, so a directory
//! listing stays chronologically meaningful once the names stop being
//! human-readable. It is canonically UPPERCASE Crockford base32, which
//! [`crate::paths::validate_tenant_name`] rejects — that validator guards
//! caller-supplied names, and a `database_id` is not one. Turning an id
//! into a path is `pd-rqgv`'s job, not this module's.
//!
//! Resolution, the CLI, and replication all live elsewhere. This module is
//! the schema and its accessor: lookup, insert, rename, detach.
//!
//! What it deliberately is *not* is the place the rules live. `database_id`
//! is the primary key, a handle's charset is a `CHECK`, and "one live user
//! per handle" is a partial unique index over `state = 'active'` — all three
//! in `schema_registry.sql`, so they hold for every writer including an
//! operator with `sqlite3` open on the file. The functions below are the
//! ergonomic path to them, not the enforcement.
