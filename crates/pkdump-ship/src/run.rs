//! The run: every registered tenant, one at a time, and what to make of how
//! it went.
//!
//! ## The unit of work is the registry
//!
//! Not `$PKDUMP_USER`. The transform tier learned this the expensive way
//! (`pd-s5yn`): a nightly job that operated on "the current user" reported
//! success for everybody while snapshotting one collection. Any successor to
//! it walks the registry, and so does this.
//!
//! ## One tenant's bad day is not the run's
//!
//! A tenant whose database is missing, locked, or not registered for a key is
//! **skipped and named**; the run carries on and says so at the end. The
//! alternative — the first failure ends the run — means the tenant sorted
//! first by ULID can stop everybody else from shipping, which is a much worse
//! failure than the one it prevents.
//!
//! ## Four answers, because there are four things to say
//!
//! | exit | meaning                                    | who hears about it |
//! |------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|
//! | 0    | every tenant shipped                       | nobody             |
//! | 2    | the run finished, some tenants were skipped| a warning          |
//! | 3    | a SEQUENCE GAP — events were lost          | a page             |
//! | 1    | the run never started, or shipped nobody   | a page             |
//!
//! 2 and 3 are separated deliberately. A skipped tenant is a normal shape of
//! night — a database mid-import, a restore in flight — and a job that paged
//! for it would be a job whose pages get ignored (`pd-me6h`). A gap is the
//! opposite: it means the online and offline sides disagree and nothing else
//! in the system would ever notice. Collapsing them would make one of the two
//! wrong, and it is not obvious afterwards which.
//!
//! 1 covers "shipped nobody at all", which 2 would otherwise swallow: a
//! missing master key or an unreachable bucket makes *every* tenant skip, and
//! a run that achieved nothing is a failure however politely each individual
//! tenant declined.
