//! [`RawLanding`] — one refresh's worth of landed bytes.
//!
//! A sink is created once per `pkdump data refresh` / `pkdump setup`
//! invocation, handed to every upstream client, and finalized when the fetch
//! phase ends — whether it ended by finishing or by failing.
//!
//! It holds one ULID for the whole invocation, so every prefix a run touches
//! carries the same `run=`, and a manifest per `(source, dataset)`, so the
//! parts of one endpoint are described by the file sitting next to them.
