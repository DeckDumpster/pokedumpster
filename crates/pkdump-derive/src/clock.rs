//! The derivation's clock — one instant, passed in, never read here.
//!
//! Before this existed, `pkdump data refresh` called `Utc::now()` five times
//! on its way down: once for the `ingest_date` partition, once for the
//! pokemontcg.io tail's `fetched_at`, twice inside the TCGCSV import (a
//! timestamp and an `observed_date`), and twice more for the Japanese pass.
//! Five reads of one clock in one job, and every one of them stamped a value
//! into a row.
//!
//! That is fine while the job is the only thing producing those rows, and
//! impossible the moment a second job has to produce the *same* rows from the
//! bytes the first one landed. So the clock is read once, at the top, and
//! carried:
//!
//! - the online refresh reads it from the actual clock, lands it in every
//!   manifest ([`Manifest::started_at`](pkdump_lake::Manifest::started_at)),
//!   and stamps it into its rows;
//! - the offline derive reads it back out of the manifest and stamps the same
//!   values into the same rows, which is what makes "row-identical" mean
//!   *identical* rather than "identical apart from the timestamps".
//!
//! [`observed_date`](DeriveClock::observed_date) is derived from that same
//! instant and stays distinct from the `ingest_date` partition, deliberately.
//! They are the same day for almost every run and differ for exactly the one
//! that crossed UTC midnight — which is the run where taking the partition
//! for the observation date would file yesterday's prices under today.
