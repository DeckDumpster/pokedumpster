//! **Backup and destruction are different paths.** This file is what makes
//! that a checked property rather than a claim in a doc comment.
//!
//! The bead (`pd-ulds`) asks for the distinction to be demonstrated "not just
//! [as] separate function names calling into shared logic that could conflate
//! the two failure modes", so it is asserted twice over, in two different
//! ways:
//!
//! 1. **Structurally** — the source of `backup.rs` is read and must not name
//!    the registry, and the source of `destroy.rs` is read and must not name
//!    the master key. Comments and doc comments are stripped first, because
//!    both modules talk about each other at length and prose is exactly what
//!    this is not about. A future edit that routes one through the other
//!    fails here, before anybody has to notice the behaviour changed.
//!
//! 2. **Behaviourally** — each path is run with the other one's world
//!    destroyed, and must be unaffected and distinguishable:
//!    * with the master key deleted, tombstoning still works, and a
//!      tombstoned tenant still reports as *revoked* while a live one reports
//!      as *broken*;
//!    * with the registry unreachable, the backup still produces the key, and
//!      failing to reach the registry never reads as a revocation.
//!
//! The failure this guards against is not hypothetical bookkeeping. If the
//! two share a mechanism then either (a) a backup failure starts looking like
//! a legitimate deletion — data loss disguised as compliance — or (b) a
//! deletion is implemented as "the backup is gone", and revokes nothing the
//! moment the backup turns up.
