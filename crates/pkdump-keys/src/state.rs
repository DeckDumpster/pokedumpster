//! The key-state registry: `database_id` → may this key still be derived?
//!
//! It is a table in `registry.sqlite`, the file that already answers "who
//! exists on this box". Three reasons it lives there rather than in a file
//! of its own:
//!
//! * it is keyed on `database_id`, which is that file's primary key;
//! * it is already replicated off-box by the Litestream sidecar and is the
//!   **first** thing restored in the total-loss procedure (`deploy/RESTORE.md`
//!   Scenario C) — so a tombstone survives a restore, which is the whole
//!   point of recording one;
//! * a second database would be a second thing to replicate, a second thing
//!   to restore, and a second chance to restore it in the wrong order.
//!
//! The table's own rules (no foreign key, absence is not permission, a
//! tombstone is terminal) live in `schema_registry.sql` where the reasoning
//! belongs. This module is the accessor.
//!
//! ## What this module deliberately cannot do
//!
//! Touch the master key. Nothing here opens, reads, writes or knows the path
//! of `tenant-master.key`. That is not an accident of the current code — it
//! is asserted by `tests/separation.rs`, because the destruction path runs
//! through this module and the backup path runs through the key file, and the
//! two staying apart is what keeps "we lost it" from ever being recorded as
//! "we destroyed it".
