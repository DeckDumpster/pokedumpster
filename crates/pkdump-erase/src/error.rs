//! What can go wrong on the deletion path, and what each failure means.
//!
//! One distinction runs through this file and it is the same one
//! [`pkdump_keys::error`] draws: **a thing that is not there** and **a thing
//! that was destroyed** are different events, and the deletion path has to
//! keep them apart in both directions.
//!
//! * On the way in, a tenant nobody has heard of is not a tenant who has been
//!   deleted, and [`EraseError::NotATenant`] says so rather than reporting a
//!   successful deletion of nothing.
//! * On the way out, a verification that failed to *run* is not a verification
//!   that *passed*, and [`EraseError::NotProven`] is what the whole item is
//!   about. Item 3's rule stated the other way round: the proof is that
//!   derivation refuses **deliberately**, so a box with no master key must
//!   never be able to report every tenant on it as deleted.
