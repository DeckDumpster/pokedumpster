//! `_manifest.json` — the answer to "did we actually get everything?",
//! readable without re-fetching a byte.
//!
//! One manifest per `(source, dataset, ingest_date, run)` prefix, sitting
//! alongside the parts it describes. It records, per part, the upstream URL,
//! the HTTP status, the uncompressed byte count and the SHA-256 of those
//! uncompressed bytes — so the stored objects can be verified against it
//! offline.
//!
//! It also records whether the run finished. A run that dies partway leaves
//! `"complete": false` and the error text that stopped it; a run that never
//! reached its finalizer leaves no manifest at all. Both are legible. What
//! must never happen is a manifest that looks whole while the prefix is
//! short.
