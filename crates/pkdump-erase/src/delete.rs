//! The deletion itself: **tombstone, then drop, then prove**.
//!
//! ```text
//!   1. tombstone   registry.sqlite : tenant_key(<id>) -> tombstoned
//!   2. drop        tenant/database_id=<id>/  emptied, object by object
//!   3. verify      every read path attempted, every one required to fail
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why the tombstone goes first
//!
//! There is no transaction across a SQLite file and an object store, so one of
//! the two happens first and a crash can land between them. The two orders
//! fail differently and only one of the failures is safe:
//!
//! * **Tombstone first** — a crash leaves a tenant whose key nothing can
//!   derive and whose objects are therefore ciphertext nobody holds a key
//!   for, with some of them still present. The shipper will not ship them
//!   again ([`pkdump_ship::run`] takes the key before it opens the database),
//!   nothing can read them, and re-running finishes the drop. The state is
//!   *more* deleted than intended, never less.
//! * **Drop first** — a crash leaves an ACTIVE tenant whose partition has
//!   vanished. Their key still derives, the shipper still ships, and the next
//!   night puts fresh holdings back under a prefix that was supposed to be
//!   gone. The deletion silently un-happens.
//!
//! So the order is not a preference. It is the difference between an
//! interrupted deletion that is safe to resume and one that reverses itself.
//!
//! ## Idempotence
//!
//! Every step is re-runnable and the whole thing is meant to be re-run:
//! tombstoning twice keeps the first record (*when* a key was destroyed is
//! part of what a tombstone is for), dropping an already-empty prefix removes
//! nothing and succeeds, and the verification is a read. A deletion
//! interrupted anywhere is finished by running it again.
//!
//! ## What it deliberately does not do
//!
//! * **It does not touch the master key.** Destroying that destroys every
//!   tenant at once, which is an outage rather than a deletion — see
//!   [`pkdump_keys::destroy`], whose whole module doc is this point.
//! * **It does not touch the tenant's SQLite database, or their registry
//!   row.** The online side of an account's removal is `pkdump tenant detach`
//!   and `pkdump tenant purge`, which are a different command in a different
//!   binary on a different box's schedule. This is the offline half, and
//!   conflating them would put a tenant-zone credential in the online CLI.
//! * **It does not un-delete.** There is no reverse. A tombstone is never
//!   lifted and the objects are gone.
