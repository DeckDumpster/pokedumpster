//! Turning a stretch of outbox rows into parts, and noticing what is missing.
//!
//! This module is pure — rows in, parts and gaps out, no database, no clock,
//! no object store. That is what lets the two properties the whole item is
//! about be asserted without standing anything up: **the same rows always
//! produce the same parts**, and **a hole in the sequence is seen**.
//!
//! ## What a part is
//!
//! A maximal run of consecutive rows sharing one UTC date, capped at
//! `max_rows`. Three boundaries, and each is there for its own reason:
//!
//! * **the date changes** — `as_of` is a partition, so a part cannot span
//!   two of them;
//! * **the sequence jumps** — a part's name is its range, and a part that
//!   skipped a number would be a range whose length lied about its contents.
//!   Splitting there keeps `to - from + 1 == rows` true of every part ever
//!   written, which is the invariant a reader can check without the outbox;
//! * **`max_rows`** — so a backlog is many objects rather than one enormous
//!   one.
//!
//! `max_rows` is therefore part of the addressing, not a tuning knob: change
//! it and a re-ship of the same rows produces differently-named parts holding
//! the same events. That is harmless (a reader keys on `seq`, and every copy
//! of a `seq` carries identical bytes) but it is not free, so it is a flag
//! with a stated default rather than something a caller passes casually.
//!
//! ## What a gap is
//!
//! The outbox's `seq` is `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` written by a
//! trigger inside the mutating transaction. `pd-5m54` proved the three
//! properties that make a hole in it meaningful: every mutation appends
//! exactly one row, a rolled-back mutation burns no number, and a trimmed
//! number is never handed out again. So the numbers this shipper does not see
//! are not numbers that were skipped — they are events that existed and were
//! **lost**.
//!
//! The first expected number is `cursor + 1`, which is why a gap at the head
//! counts: rows deleted after the cursor passed them are gone legitimately,
//! and rows deleted *before* it reached them are not.
