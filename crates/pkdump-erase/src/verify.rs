//! **The proof.** "Proven, not asserted" is the literal bar this item was
//! written to, and this module is where the bar is met.
//!
//! A deletion that ran without error is not a deletion that worked. What is
//! checked here is the opposite claim, from the reader's side: for a deleted
//! `database_id`, every path by which that tenant's holdings or valuations
//! could still be reached is closed.
//!
//! ```text
//!   ┌── machinery ──── the box can still derive SOMEBODY's key
//!   │                  (without this, every check below is vacuous)
//!   ├── derivation ─── this tenant's key refuses, DELIBERATELY
//!   ├── partition ──── the tenant prefix lists nothing
//!   ├── dataset=… ──── and neither does any single dataset under it
//!   └── stray copy ─── a byte-for-byte copy taken BEFORE the deletion does
//!                      not open, because there is no key left to open it
//! ```
//!
//! ## The two ways a proof can be worthless, and what stops each
//!
//! **Vacuity from a broken box.** A box with no master key derives nothing
//! for anybody, so "no key could be derived" would be true of every tenant
//! alive. [`Check::Machinery`] runs first and establishes that the key
//! machinery works *at all*; the stray-copy check refuses to conclude
//! anything if it did not. The derivation check is immune for a different
//! reason and it is item 3's: [`pkdump_keys::tenant_key`] consults the
//! registry BEFORE the master key, so `Tombstoned` is a fact about a row and
//! can never be produced by a missing file. This module insists on that
//! specific error rather than on any error, which is the whole of the
//! difference between "we destroyed this" and "we lost everything".
//!
//! **Vacuity from a meaningless subject.** A stray copy that is not a sealed
//! tenant-zone object proves nothing by failing to open — a text file does
//! not open either. So the copy is checked for the envelope magic first, and
//! a copy that is not one makes the check *fail* rather than pass.
//!
//! ## It answers the other way too
//!
//! Run against a tenant who has NOT been deleted, [`verify`] reports NOT
//! PROVEN and says which paths are still open — including opening the stray
//! copy and saying so. That is deliberate: a check that can only ever report
//! success is not a check, and this one is run in the failing direction by
//! both gates before it is trusted in the passing one.
